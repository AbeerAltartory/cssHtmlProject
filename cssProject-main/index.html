            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
   I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and building valuable projects.

I love learning and have a growing interest in developing and designing websites and web pages.

As a core part of my day, I explore programming challenges and try to learn from them.

I can understand object-oriented programming (OOP) and use it in small projects.

I took a web course: Skills acquired: Learned web design and development techniques such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built interactive websites and experimented with user interface design. Learned the basics of back-end development using technologies such as PHP or Node.js. Benefits gained: This course helped me develop my skills in creating websites from scratch and designing attractive user interfaces.

Personal and technical skills:
Teamwork.
Problem-solving skills.
Ability to self-learn and develop skills.</p>
